Interfacing light sensor TSL2561 with Raspberry Pi


The TSL2561 luminosity sensor is an advanced digital light sensor ideal for use in a wide range of light situations. Compared to low cost CdS cells, this sensor is more precise allowing for exact Lux calculations and can be configured for different gain/timing ranges to detect light ranges from up to 0.1 â€“ 40,000+ Lux on the fly. The best part of this sensor is that it contains both infrared and full spectrum diodes. This means one can separately measure infrared, full-spectrum or human-visible light.
